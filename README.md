Provides more clicks options: you can set some built-in action (or write any custom action) for click (right-click, Shift+left-click, etc.) on some items like links (or you can add detect function for any other items).

This is very old project (version 0.0.1.0a1 was created at 2008-08-28), it contain many obsolete codes (especially due to removed E4X), supports only clicks inside main browser window and contains many features, that not tested in new browser versions. Unfortunately I don't have enough free time to debug and make something release-like, so finally I decided to make it public "as is".
